# GDExtension Template

I love C++ -- I use it all the time, and for actual gameplay mechanics (especially CPU-intensive ones), I much prefer working in it.

That being said, I *don't* love it for GUI programming or any of the fiddly surface-layer stuff that goes into a game -- and that's the stuff Godot excels at! So the solution is to use a GDExtension, which is to say, a C++ module that you can use right from Godot.

This repo is meant to be a template. Clone or download this code, then copy or paste it into your project (I personally like to use `/ext` within my godot project root, which with the included scripts, will then build the extension binary into `/bin`, which is not gd-ignored). Just make sure you keep godot-cpp as a submodule, so that you can keep up to date with the latest library code in that repo.
